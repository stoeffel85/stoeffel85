### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a chemist & University teacher working on Enzymes and Light (Photobiocatalysis). 
I like to code and try to motivate my students to experiment with it. 
This led to the development of online tools that are handy for some of our research problems and to the development of a Raspberry Pi based photoreactor that we use routinely to perform our experiments. Check out the repositories!
